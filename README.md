<h1>BitSplit</h1>
BitSplit is a user-friendly file synchronization, sharing, and backup program for Windows, Mac, and Linux. BitSplit allows you to easily create, fine-tune, and automate your backups so you never have to worry about losing your files again.

I began development of this project during my third year in college, and though I had to put it aside to focus on study and work, I thought I'd open source what I created.

Syncing your files has never been easier. Have you ever found with other backup programs that you'll move a file or rename a folder and suddenly you're told that you need to copy what you've just changed? Not with BitSplit! It can keep track of what you've moved, renamed, updated or deleted (and any combination of those!) and make the necessary changes to the existing files in the backup, saving needless copying from happening.

Ever wanted to share stuff with your friends but you don't want to see what you already have in common? Well BitSplit makes that easy. It'll only list the files you need to make it easy to pick and choose what you want copied. No more trawling through folders looking for new stuff.
